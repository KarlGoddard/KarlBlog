          <h2>This photo was taken last week by the Phorous IV module on its journey beyond the Solar System</h2>
          <p>In the distant background is Triton, the largest of Neptune's known 14 moons.
            It seems likely that records will known be updated to document that Neptune now has 15 moons.</p>
          <p>Initial estimates believe the new moon (in the foreground) is slightly smaller than Triton.  Although, it isn't the largest, this new moon can claim to be the hottest on Neptune and perhaps the fastest in the known solar system.</p>

          <h3>Orbit speed</h3>
          <p>This moon appears to be travelling at incredible speed as it orbits Neptune.  Our own moon is estimated to travel at about 1km per second as it orbits Earth.  This new moon appears to be orbiting at 30km per second!
          It is thought, this might be the reason is has evaded detection for so long.  Past sightings have assumed it's signature to belong to some other celestial object and dismissed as too fast to be a moon.</p>

        <h3>Temperature</h3>
        <p>At the outer reaches of our solar system as the planets lie further from the sun, their tempatures drop dramatically, reaching sub-zero figures that cannot be matched anywhere on our planet.
          Beyond Mars, most of the planets are built from a mass of frozen gasses.  This new moon is displaying temperatures close to 0 degrees celsius!
          While this might not seem incredible to us, it's the equivalent of a molten volcano compared to it's frozen counterparts on the edge of our known world.
          This may be related to its speed.  There is visible turbulence as this moon, leaves a gaseous trail in its wake.  From a different angle, it looks like the classic picture of a meteorite entering our own planet's atmosphere and burning up.</p>
